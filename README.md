# Welcome to the Microbiome Mystery Module

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to determine which microbiome sample belongs to which subject in this study. There are 12 subjects, number 1 through 12, with the following backgrounds:

* C. Diff patient
* A newborn
* A C-section newborn
* Rural Malawian
* Swabbed your mouth by mistake
* Just took antibiotics
* Joe yesterday
* Joe today
* Crohn's disease
* Healthy US adult
* Healthy Rural Amazonian
* Carnivore

Which subject is the C. Diff patient? Which subject is the Healthy US adult? Follow the clues to find the answers!
